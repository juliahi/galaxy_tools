   Find two types of reads in BAM file:
      * NON-unique reads - non-uniquely mapped reads, i.e. reads with mapping quality less/equal 3 (meaning they are mapped to at least two locations)
      * duplicated reads - reads mapped onto same starting position as another read, with the same sequence (or longer).
